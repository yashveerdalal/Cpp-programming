// Certainly! Here are the rules and conventions for naming variables in C++ without code examples:

// # Basic Rules

// 1. Start with a Letter or Underscore: Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot start with a digit.

// 2. Followed by Letters, Digits, or Underscores**: After the initial character, names can include letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.

// 3. Case Sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning `variable`, `Variable`, and `VARIABLE` are treated as distinct names.

// 4. No Reserved Words: Variable names cannot be the same as C++ reserved keywords or standard library identifiers.

// # Naming Conventions

// 1. Descriptive Names: Choose names that clearly describe the variableâ€™s purpose or role in the code.

// 2. Camel Case: Common practice is to use camelCase, where the first word is lowercase and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.

// 3. Underscores: An alternative convention is to use underscores to separate words, known as snake_case.

// 4. Prefixing: For class member variables, some use a prefix like an underscore or `m_` to differentiate them from local variables.

// 5. Constants: Typically written in uppercase with words separated by underscores.

// # Scope and Duration

// 1.  Local Variables: Named based on their purpose and usually follow camelCase or underscore conventions.

// 2. Global Variables: Often use a naming convention that distinguishes them from local variables.

// 3. Static Variables: Consistently named to indicate their static nature.

// Following these guidelines helps ensure that code is clear, understandable, and maintainable.
