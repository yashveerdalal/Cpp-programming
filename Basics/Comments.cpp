//     In coding, a **comment** is a piece of text in the source code that is not executed by the compiler or interpreter. Instead, comments are used to provide explanations, annotations, or reminders about the code. They help make the code more understandable to humans, including the original author and others who might read or maintain the code later.

// Here are a few key points about comments:

// 1. Purpose: They describe what the code does, why certain decisions were made, or provide other relevant information that might not be immediately obvious from the code itself.

// 2. Syntax: The syntax for comments varies depending on the programming language. For example:
//    - In Python, comments are denoted by the `#` symbol (e.g., `# This is a comment`).
//    - In JavaScript, comments can be single-line using `//` (e.g., `// This is a single-line comment`) or multi-line using `/* ... */` (e.g., `/* This is a multi-line comment */`).
//    - In Java and C++, single-line comments use `//` and multi-line comments use `/* ... */`.

// 3. **Best Practices**: 
//    - **Clarity**: Comments should be clear and concise.
//    - **Relevance**: They should be relevant and help in understanding the code.
//    - **Maintenance**: Comments should be updated when the code changes to avoid misleading information.

// Overall, comments are a crucial part of writing maintainable and understandable code.
